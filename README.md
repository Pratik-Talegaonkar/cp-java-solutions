# Competitive Programming Practice

This repository contains my **competitive programming practice** — solved problems, experiments, and learnings as I work through the **CP-31 sheet by TLE Eliminators** and participate in contests from time to time.

This is not a polished library or tutorial repo.  
It’s a **practice ground**.

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repo

- Track my progress in competitive programming
- Build consistency and problem-solving discipline
- Improve logic, speed, and implementation skills
- Revisit mistakes and patterns over time

Most solutions are written with clarity in mind, but the main focus is **learning**, not perfection.

---

## 📂 What You’ll Find Here

- Solutions to problems from the **CP-31 Sheet (TLE Eliminators)**
- Contest problem solutions (whenever I participate)
- Code written primarily for correctness and efficiency
- Occasional comments or notes where something interesting or tricky came up

Languages used may include:
- **Java**
- **C / C++**
- **Python**
(depending on the problem and mood)

---

## 🧠 How I Use This Repo

- Solve → submit → push
- Revisit hard problems later
- Identify common patterns (DP, greedy, binary search, etc.)
- Measure improvement over time rather than chase ratings

This repo is more about **process** than results.

---

## 🌱 Ongoing

- Actively working through the CP-31 sheet
- Participating in contests when possible
- Continuously refining problem-solving skills

---

## ⚠️ Note

Solutions here reflect my understanding **at the time of solving**.  
Some may be suboptimal or messy — that’s part of the learning curve.
